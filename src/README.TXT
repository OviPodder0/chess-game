Outstanding Issues: The Bishop, Queen and the Castle jump over the pieces in front of them.
	I tried several ways to fix the bugs but those methods did not work

PROJECT TITLE: ASSIGNMENT 3


PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I will be upgrading the previous assignment(Checkers) into a Chess game. I will be working with Multi Dimensional
	arrays  and StdDraw(Graphics). I was provided with a GameController.java which handles the game logic and input, a 
	Board.java which holds the pieces and also a TestClass.java to help me test as I moved along.

 
VERSION or DATE: 15 Nov 2020


HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: To start the project, the Bishop.java,Board.java,Castle.java,ChessPiece.java,GameController.java,
	King.java,Knight.java,Pawn.java,Queen.java,StdDraw.java , TestClass.java,StandardBoard.txt and the Piecesfolder must be in the same folder.
	Then right click on StandardBoard.txt and go to Properties. In Properties, in General tab, copy the Loaction. Then
	open the GameController.java. There in Line 21, BoardLoader.loadBoardState(board, ""), paste the location in the quotation
	and in the end of the location type "\\StandardBoard.txt".
	For Example: BoardLoader.loadBoardState(board, "E:\\Materials\\UTP 2\\COM 1020\\Java\\A3\\Assignment 3\\src\\StandardBoard.txt");
	Then Run the GameController.java file
